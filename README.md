A bug when using riverpod

these are all the files i reverse engineered from someone else in other to get the chats and status working correctly
all you have to do is create a main.dart add provider scope
next create a button to navigate to contacts_list.dart
next wired up chats and status to firebase servers and the error will appear the first time send a message, only the firts time that it will appear.
